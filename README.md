# Snake, Water, Gun Game

A classic command-line implementation of the Snake, Water, Gun game, built using Python. This project was created to practice and demonstrate fundamental Python concepts, including loops, conditional logic, user input handling, and code structure.

## Features

* Interactive Gameplay: Play against the computer directly in your terminal.
* Randomized Choices: The computer's choice is randomized in every round for replayability.
* Input Validation: The game gracefully handles invalid user inputs and prompts the user to try again.
* Play Again: A `while` loop allows you to play multiple rounds without restarting the script.
* Simple Quit: Easily exit the game by typing 'q'.

## Tech Stack

* Language: Python 3
* Core Library: `random`

## How to Run

To run this game on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

1.  Prerequisite: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AK3D2Y/SWG---Snake-Water-Gun---Game--.git](https://github.com/AK3D2Y/SWG---Snake-Water-Gun---Game--.git)
    ```

3.  Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd SWG---Snake-Water-Gun---Game--
    ```

4.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py or python3 main.py
    ```

## Developer's Note

As a developer just starting my journey, my primary goal for this project was to write clear, readable, and functional code. I chose to implement the win/loss logic using a straightforward `if/elif/else` ladder because it's self-documenting and easy for anyone to understand at a glance.

During this process, I also explored a more concise mathematical solution using the modulo operator. Ultimately, I prioritized code clarity for this project, which is a key principle I'm learning to value as a developer.
